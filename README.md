## Apocalypse Phoenix

The Apocalypse Phoenix evolved from the Phoenix, but instead of a mastery of fire, they have mastery over explosions. Consuming gunpowder or standing in the sun charges your explosive reserves, then you can release a series of blasts from your location or as a thrown bomb. Of course the Apocalypse Phoenix can still fly, use explosive propulsion to manage your stamina.

### Apocalypse Phoenix True Form Powers

**Positive**
- Explosive Propulsion: Propel yourself through the air using your stored gunpowder! Less destructive than other abilities. Also replenishes some flight stamina.
- Erupting Call: Explode the powder stores in your body, the more stored powder the large the explosion. (Damages terrain and nearby entities)
- Explosive Diet: Consuming Gunpowder refills your explosion meter.
- Thrive in Chaos: You do not take damage from explosions.
- Firebomb: Throw out a giant bomb that explodes after a short time.
- Powder Storage: Store gunpowder in your body to fuel your abilities.
- Helios' Blessing: When under direct sunlight, you receive a speed boost on land and in the air. You also slowly generate powder for your stores.
- Ingenuity: You're able to extract explosive powders from most mobs. They will occasionally drop additional gunpowder or other goodies.
- Rebirth: Upon death, revert to your Rebirth Form in a *devastating* explosion.


**Neutral**
- Flight Stamina: Flying reduces your stamina, land to replenish it. If you run out you will fall slower and not take fall damage. However, you will have to wait for the bar to refill before flying again.
- Risky Business: While holding a tnt in your offhand you slowly gain food. Crouch and stay still to ponder the beautiful explosive, gaining additional sustenance. Sometimes this destabilizes the explosive...
- Small Body: You're slightly smaller than your average Steve.

**Negative**
- Small Health: You have less maximum health.
- More Kinetic Damage: You take more damage from falling and flying into blocks.
- Water Weakness: Water slows you down and stops your abilities from igniting.

### Apocalypse Phoenix Rebirth Form Powers

**Positive**
- Rejuvenation: Be reborn in your True Form after enough time in the sun and/or roosting.
- Roost: While sneaking and not moving, you will gain progress towards Rejuvenating, regardless of there being sunlight or not.
- Gliding: You're just a little chick, you can jump higher and fall like a feather, you also have better air control.
- Sunlight: While standing in the sun you gain progress toward Rejuvenating. Standing in Rain or Water will leech this progress.
- Helios Blessing: When under direct sunlight, you receive a speed boost on land and in the air.
- Ingenuity: You're able to extract explosive powders from most mobs. They will occasionally drop additional gunpowder or other goodies.
- Fire Immunity: You're immune to fire damage. (Not lava like your ancestors, though)

**Neutral**
- Tiny Body: You're only 1 block tall. Quite tiny, really.
- Wings: You have wings! But you must ascend before you can fly.
- Risky Business: While holding a tnt in your offhand you slowly gain food. Crouch and stay still to ponder the beautiful explosive, gaining additional sustenance. Sometimes this destabilizes the explosive...

**Negative**
- Tiny Health: You have even less maximum health.
